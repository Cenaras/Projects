Notes:
Lex Assignments; i.e. <LET>

Start on the parser. Simple stuff, only BinOps and Assignment Statements
Figure out if program is list of statements or can be expression

Start on type checker of simple programs - BinOps again.

LLVM as Intermediate Representation language? Or something else better suited for Java?

Convert to Java ByteCode I guess?
