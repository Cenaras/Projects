Theorem ex_falso_quodlibet : forall (P:Prop),
  False -> P.
Proof.
  intros P contra.
  inversion contra.  Qed.

    identifiers and numbers. *)

Inductive id : Type :=

Definition beq_id (x x' : id) : bool :=
  match x, x' with
  | Id y, Id y' => beq_nat y y'
  end.
Lemma beq_id_refl : forall x : id,
  true = beq_id x x.
Proof.
  intros x; destruct x as [y]; simpl; apply beq_nat_refl.
Qed.
Lemma beq_id_eq: forall x x' : id,
  true = beq_id x x' -> x = x'.
Proof.
  intros x x' H; destruct x as [y]; destruct x' as [y']; simpl in H.
  apply beq_nat_eq in H. rewrite H. reflexivity.
Qed.
